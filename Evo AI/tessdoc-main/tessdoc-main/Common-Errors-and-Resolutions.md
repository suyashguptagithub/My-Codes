## Errors during LSTM Training

See Ray Smith's notes in [TrainingTesseract 4.00](tess4/TrainingTesseract-4.00.md),
specifically the section on [errors](tess4/TrainingTesseract-4.00.md#error-messages-from-training).


## Errors related to Tesseract API

### Error if locale settings are not equal to "C"

Normal C++ programs like those which are built for tesseract automatically
set the locale "C".

There can be different locale settings if the tesseract library is used
in other software.

A wrong locale can cause wrong results from `sscanf()` which is used at
different places in the tesseract code, so make sure that we have the
right locale settings and fail if that is not the case.

```
!strcmp(locale, "C"):Error:Assert failed:in file baseapi.cpp, line 192
```

You have to find out whether the "C" locale works with your code or you must restore
the original locale after calling the Tesseract API.


## Errors related to Tesseract CLI
