# API example for user patterns

User patterns can be useful when recognizing ID type of fields which have non-dictionary words but follow specific patterns of alphabets and digits e.g. `\A\A\d\d\d\d\A`  or `\A\A\d\d\d\A`

This documentation provides a simple example on how to use the tesseract-ocr API
(4.x) in C++ for applying _user patterns_ for improving recognition.
It is expected that tesseract-ocr is correctly installed including all dependencies.
It is expected the user is familiar with C++, compiling and linking program on their platform.

This is based on [an example provided in tesseract-ocr forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/tesseract-ocr/y052O_DwYic/gsJN1NHBfqkJ) and updated for the [recent implementation of the feature for tesseract 4.x](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/pull/2328).

Please note that while this example gets 100% accuracy after user_patterns are applied, that may not always be the case. User patterns (like user dictionaries) are merely applied as a _hint_ while decoding, but not exclusively. [Pre-processing the image](ImproveQuality.md) usually improves the quality of recognition and is recommended.

## Requirements

In order to apply user patterns for improving recognition, the following are required.

### _user patterns file_

The _user patterns file_ should contain one pattern per line in UTF-8 format.  In choosing which patterns to include please be aware of the fact that providing very generic patterns will make tesseract run slower. Best results may be obtained by having a single pattern in the file.

Details of type of patterns that can be used are given in [trie.h](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract/blob/main/src/dict/trie.h#L185).

#### Example of a user patterns file

Make a text file, and write each pattern on a separate line, with UNIX line endings (line-feed character) and a blank line at the end, e.g.

```
\A\A\d\d\d\d\A

```

In the following, let's assume you named that pattern file `path/to/my.patterns`.

### _config file_

For the API, the information about the _user patterns file_ needs to be specified in a _config file_.

(For the CLI, this works as well, but there is also a direct option for the _user patterns file_ alone.)

#### Example of a config file

Make a text file, and write `user_patterns_file` into it verbatim, followed by the path name in one line, with UNIX line endings (line-feed character) and a blank line at the end, e.g.

```
user_patterns_file path/to/my.patterns

```

In the following, let's assume you named that config file `path/to/my.patterns.config`.

## CLI Example

From the command line, user patterns can be invoked as follows:

```sh
tesseract input.tif output --user-patterns path/to/my.patterns
```

## API Example

Take the following _image file_ (`Arial.png`) as input:

 <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5095331/60698052-34c08680-9f0b-11e9-8c9a-7c1aaa9b1e02.png" height=400>

The following code uses the above _user patterns file_ and _config file_ on that _image file_:

```C++
#include <tesseract/baseapi.h>
#include <leptonica/allheaders.h>

int main()
{
    Pix *image;
    char *outText;
    char *configs[]={"path/to/my.patterns.config"};
    int configs_size = 1;
    tesseract::TessBaseAPI *api = new tesseract::TessBaseAPI();
    if (api->Init(NULL, "eng", tesseract::OEM_LSTM_ONLY, configs, configs_size, NULL, NULL, false)) {
      fprintf(stderr, "Could not initialize tesseract.\n");
      exit(1);
    }
    image = pixRead("Arial.png");
    api->SetImage(image);
    outText = api->GetUTF8Text();
    printf(outText);
    api->End();
    delete api;
    delete [] outText;
    pixDestroy(&image);
    return 0;
}

```

Build and run script

```sh
#!/bin/bash

export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=$CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH:/usr/local/include
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib

g++ -std=c++17  -o my.patterns.api my.patterns.api.cpp   -llept -ltesseract

export TESSDATA_PREFIX=~/tessdata_best

./my.patterns.api > Arial-patterns.txt

diff -u  Arial-patterns.txt  Arial-gt.txt
```

With the _user patterns file_ for this image, the recognition is 100% correct. Without it, there are a number of errors:
